gpsmethod:
	Tries to calculate the position of the second camera in the first
	camera's base. Doesn't seem to work, because if you try to calculate
	first camera coordinates in first camera base, it doesn't return 
	(0,0,0).

twocameras:
	Just run with --help option for help.
	If something doesn't work, probably it works in OpenCV 2.4.0.
	Please, inform me.
	


solvepnpcameraposition:
	First run:
		solvepnpcameraposition
	And press space for saving the chessboard position. You have to save
	10 positions to calibrate the camera. It will be saved into 
	calib.dat.
	Next you must see on your screen the camera drawed by pygame opengl. 

findHomography:
	Reads the camera and tries to transform it to match the original
	position of chessboard in the smallchessboard.jpg image
	You can specify an integer as the first argument, it will be
	considered as the video source, or a filename, which will be taken
	as the source
	Pattern must be 9x6 inner corners. Other can be defined in the file
	
calibrateMyCamera:
	Reads the camera, searches for the chessboard and tries to calibrate
	the camera, printing the tvecs and rvecs for each capture.
	rvecs and tvecs are the rotation and translation vectors for the
	current chessboard.
	Pattern must be 9x6 inner corners. Other can be defined in the file.
	
findChessboard:
	Just an example of findChessboard funcion.
