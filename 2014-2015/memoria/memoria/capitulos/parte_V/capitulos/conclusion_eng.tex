\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{General conclusions}
The usage of Computer Vision and its algorithms to process images is are
still something new and not so extended. Nevertheless, its potential is
enormous. Starting with low knowledge in the area, this project is an
example of the versatility of these techniques for specific cases in
the real world. There is still much to investigate in this branch
of the Computer Science, and we are proud of taking a part in a project
of these characteristics.\\
When people talk about Computer Vision maybe they tend to think,
innocently, that it is a specific area of Computer Science. However
it goes further, because its functionalities can be applied to each
type of image, which in this case are \emph{tomographies}.
The results of processing them were really satisfactory, for us and
for the medical team that collaborated with us in the project, 
providing technical knowledge in the area and images to study.

\section{Conclusions about pores detection in the papilla}
The detection of pores in the optical papilla has succeeded thanks
, in part, to the SimpleCV library and its functionalities to detect 
\emph{blobs}. It has achieved a nimble time of processing comparing
it to the time spent by medical staff to mark them. Also their 
measurement is still more precise than the estimation they were doing
until now. \\
The next images show and example:

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \caption{Original Image}
      \centering \setlength\fboxsep{0pt} \setlength\fboxrule{0.5pt}
      \fbox{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{imagenes/conclusiones/PorosOriginal.png}}
    \end{figure}

Using the tradicional method, the result is the following:

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \caption{Image given by medical staff}
      \centering \setlength\fboxsep{0pt} \setlength\fboxrule{0.5pt}
      \fbox{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{imagenes/conclusiones/PorosMedicos.png}}
    \end{figure}

Our algorithms can detect still more pores as it can be seen in the next images.\\
OpenCV algorithm:

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \caption{OpenCV algorithm}
      \centering \setlength\fboxsep{0pt} \setlength\fboxrule{0.5pt}
      \fbox{\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{imagenes/conclusiones/PorosOpenCV.png}}
    \end{figure}

SimpleCV algorithm:

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \caption{SimpleCV algorithm}
      \centering \setlength\fboxsep{0pt} \setlength\fboxrule{0.5pt}
      \fbox{\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{imagenes/conclusiones/PorosSimpleCV.png}}
    \end{figure}

The detection with these algorithms is faster and more reliable, and it
also provides the exact pores' size. This way it is not necessary to
estimate the ratio of the pores extension over the papilla surface.


\section{Conclusions about the measurement of the choroid thickness}
About the usage of Computer Vision algorithms for the measurement of
the \emph{choroid} thickness, the results could not be better:
it has reached an exact precission in the measurement for the majority
of the images and imperceptible diferences in the worst cases, when
the noise or quality make the detection of the points harder.
Also the time of processing got reduced to less than a second without
the need of a doctor to do it. This caused the imprecissions due to human failure to disappear
, as we can see in the next example:

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \caption{Manually measurement}
      \centering \setlength\fboxsep{0pt} \setlength\fboxrule{0.5pt}
      \fbox{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imagenes/conclusiones/EjemploConclusionMedicos.png}}
    \end{figure}

If we use our algorithm and combine the images in order to compare them:

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \caption{Our algorithm measurement}
      \centering \setlength\fboxsep{0pt} \setlength\fboxrule{0.5pt}
      \fbox{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{imagenes/conclusiones/EjemploConclusionCombinada.png}}
    \end{figure}

As we can see, the line manually drawn (the yellow one)
tends to go right. The cause of this mistake is the dificulty for the brain
to draw a perpendicular line when the image is spined. \\
Also the halo generated by the reflection of the light on the tissue
has been removed from the measurement to prevent mistakes at the 
measurement time.
